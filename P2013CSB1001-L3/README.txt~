I have plotted 9 graphs in Test script for 'boat.tif'
In the first row ,number of iterations keeps increasing while the other values remain constant.
In the second row ,lambda keeps increasing while the other values remain constant.
In the first row ,sigma keeps increasing while the other values remain constant.
